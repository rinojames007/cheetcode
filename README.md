# cheetcode

a clone of leetcode i made just for fun.
figured out the front and back end code base, yet to link both.. probably in the coming future!

deployed it for everyone to watch.

got to learn a lot while making it.
```
-> working of react and its various hooks
-> understanding deployment of projects
-> making necessary changed not on the main branch, instead making change on a new branch, doing a PR
-> make the deployment process smooth enough
```

watch it live on -> https://cheetcode.vercel.app
