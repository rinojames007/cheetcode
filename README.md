# cheetcode

a clone of leetcode i made just for fun.
figured out the front and back end code base, yet to link both.. probably in the coming future!

deployed it for everyone to watch.

watch it live on -> https://cheetcode.vercel.app

I am learning a lot while making this project.
-> learning about proposing changes via PRs, reviewing, merging them.
-> understanding about the deployement and making the not directly merging your code to the main branch, rather make it in a smoother fashion.

-> will switch the repo codebase completely from JavaScript to TypeScript.
